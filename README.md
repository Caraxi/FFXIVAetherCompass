# Aether Compass

"""
Have you ever run into something when looking at your compass ... oooops!
"""

_Aether Compass_ is an FFXIV Dalamud plugin that has a compass (a set of compasses, actually) 
that automatically detects certain objects/NPCs such as Aether Currents nearby and shows where they are.

Detected objects/NPCs are displayed in various ways, 
notably through markers on your screen that points to the locations of these objects/NPCs.
Optionally, it can notify you through Chat and/or Toast messages.

Currently supports detecting:
- Aether Currents
- Mob Hunt Elite Marks (Notorious Monsters)

... and more are on the way.
