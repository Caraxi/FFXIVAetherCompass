_Aether Compass_ is an FFXIV Dalamud plugin that has a compass (a set of compasses, actually) 
that automatically detects certain objects/NPCs such as Aether Currents nearby and shows where they are.

Detected objects/NPCs are displayed in various ways, 
notably through markers on your screen that point to the locations of these objects/NPCs.
Optionally, it can notify you through Chat and/or Toast messages.

Currently supports detecting:
- Aether Currents
- Mob Hunt Elite Marks (Notorious Monsters)
- Gathering Points
- *\[Experimental\] Quest-related NPCs/Objects*

**NOTE:** Because most objects/NPCs are not loaded 
when they are too faraway or when there are too many entities nearby (such as too many player characters), 
they will not be detected in this case.


## Installation

[XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) is required to install and run the plugin.

Add my [Dalamud plugin repo](https://github.com/yomishino/MyDalamudPlugins) to Dalamud's Custom Plugin Repositories.

Once added, look for the plugin "Aether Compass" in Plugin Installer's available plugins.
